Description:
I made whatsapp UI, in telegram style.

- The main changes I saw were that whatsapp uses a lot of green color, and telegram uses blue color instead.
- WhatsApp focuses on general bottom navbar, and top bar, and proper buttons...
- Telegram has a more modern look. It focusses on floating buttons, with shadows. Navbar is also floating.
- Telegram also has a bit of glassmorphism.
